# keras_elmo_bert

This repository contains the wrapper of Elmo and Bert models as a keras layer and special tokenizers that allow you to quickly transform raw text into the format you need for these models. Please see example_notebook.ipynb to understand how it works. 

The ideas outlined here are a continuation of the remarkable work on the use of tf-hub models from https://github.com/strongio/keras-bert
